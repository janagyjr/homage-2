# Homage 2: The Journey Continues

Homage is meant to be a tribute to someone whose mods I really love. Yes, more than that mod, and that one, and the other one over there. McJty's mods allow you to do things in ways that aren't always obvious but always fun and innovative.

Where Homage introduced you to his mods in a very basic way (so far, I do plan more configuration updates for that pack), I hope to have more advanced integration of his mods in Homage 2, along with custom achievements and maybe a guide book to give ideas/goals for those who just don't know where to go in exploring the mods.
